# just_oww
A CLI for creating Create React Components 

## Why
Well I needed a light weight simple React component creator cli tool that is highly customizable
### Commands

```
just_oww component Button
```

This command will create a ``Button.tsx``, ``index.ts`` and ``Button.scss`` component in src/components if you would like to overwrite where to write the components.

```
just_oww component Button --directory ./src/components/common
```
